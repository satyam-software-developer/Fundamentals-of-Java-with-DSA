//Creating a Thread by Extending Thread class
//Multithreading In Java :
//        Used to maximize the CPU utilization.
//        We don't want our CPU to be in a free state; for example, Func1() comes into the memory and demands any input/output process.
//        The CPU will need to wait for unit Func1() to complete its input/output operation in such a condition.
//        But, while Func1() completes its I/O operation, the CPU is free and not executing any thread.
//        So, the efficiency of the CPU is decreased in the absence of multithreading.
//        In the case of multithreading, if a thread demands any I/O operation, then the CPU will let the thread perform its I/O operation,
//        but it will start the execution of a new thread parallelly. So, in this case, two threads are executing at the same time.
//        Flow Of Control In Java :
//        1. Without threading :
//
//class ThreadExample{
//    public static void main(String[] args) {
//        Func1();
//        Func2();
//    }
//}
//    In the above code, you can see that Func1() and Func2() are called inside the main() function.
//        But the execution of Func2() will start only after the completion of the Func1().
//
//        2. With threading :
//class Multi extends Thread{
//    public void run(){
//        System.out.println("thread is running...");
//    }
//    public static void main(String args[]){
//        Multi func1=new Multi();
//        func1.start();
//        Multi func2=new Multi();
//        func2.start();
//    }
//}
//Again, Func1() and Func2() are called inside the main function, but none of the two functions is waiting for the execution of the other function.
//        Both the functions are getting executed concurrently.
//
//        Ways To Create A Thread In Java
//        By extending the thread class
//By implementing a Runnable interface
//Let's see how we can create a thread by extending the thread class.
//
//        Extending Thread Class :
//        To create a thread using the thread class, we need to extend the thread class.
//        Java's multithreading system is based on the thread class.
//
//class MyThread extends Thread{
//    @Override
//    public void run(){
//        //code that we want to get executed on running the thread
//    }
//}
//    In the above code, we're first inheriting the Thread class and then overriding the run() method.
//        The code you want to execute on the thread's execution goes inside the run() method.
//class MyThread extends Thread{
//    @Override
//    public void run(){
//        int i =0;
//        while(i<40000){
//            System.out.println("My Cooking Thread is Running");
//            System.out.println("I am happy!");
//            i++;
//        }
//    }
//}
//public class cwh_70 {
//    public static void main(String[] args) {
//        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
//        t1.start();
//    }
//}
//    In order to execute the thread, the start() method is used. start() is called on the object of the MyThread class.
//        It automatically calls the run() method, and a new stack is provided to the thread.
//        So, that's how you easily create threads by extending the thread class in Java.
