//Java Collections Framework
//        Collection Framework
//        A collection represents a group of object Java collections provide classes and Interfaces for us
//        to be able to write code interfaces for us to be able to write code quickly and efficiently
//
//        Why do we need collections
//
//        We need collections for efficient storage and better manipulation of data in java
//
//        For ex: we use arrays to store integers but what if we want to
//
//        Resize this array?
//        Insert an element in between?
//        Delete an elements in Array?
//        Apply certain operations to change this array?
